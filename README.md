## LLM-assisted development

developed by prompting GPT-4 and combining its semi-random recommendations with
a vague idea of what tech and techniques i wanted to use and iterating from
there.

I take all responsibility for code quality.

As always, i give thanks to the many developers from whom our new tools are
stealing/learning. this code is GPL in recognition.
